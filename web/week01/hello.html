# 01 Ponder : Weekly Reflection


1. Describe one challenge your team experienced working on the Hello World activity.
Downloading the correct version of intelij



2. For the NSA Cryptography assignment, what did you learn about how Java parameter passing differs from C++?
I didn't ever run into any problem passing so I never had to do any searching to figure out what was different.


3. Did you complete the Stretch Challenge for the NSA Cryptography? If so, briefly describe what you did, and how you structured your code.
I did but I ended up putting the password verification in side of my own password verifier function  instead of the hash function. 


4. What did you learn from comparing your code to the teacher's solution?
It turned out that I was closer then I was expecting to be but my structure was off.


5. After completing the assignments this week, what questions do you still have?
We talked a lot about the differences of c++ but I found that to be a little confusing without being reminded of what is 
still the same. What do I not need to relearn? 


6. If you were getting paid to work on this week's Prove assignment and you had another month to work on it, what would you add?
I would have the hash and salt stored on server and would make the user interface more clean.


7. A common Java interview question is "What are javadocs and when should they be used?". How would you answer that question?
From what I can tell they should be used whenever you have function that is new and could be hard to understand without the proper documentation. 


8. Of all of the resources in this week's Preparation assignment, which was the _most_ helpful to you and why?
The Internet is always the safe answer but it was friends who can answer long questions in just seconds that was the 
winner this week.


9. Of all of the resources in this week's Preparation assignment, which was the _least_ helpful to you and why?
All of the comment in the beginning of the NSA file.
